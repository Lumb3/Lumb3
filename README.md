# 👋 Hello there! I'm Erkhembileg

🎓 I'm a Computer Engineering student at the **University of Utah** with a big passion for connecting **hardware** and **software** into something meaningful. From crafting AI models to analyzing electrical circuits, I love bringing ideas to life through logic and creativity.

This GitHub is where I share my journey — whether it's low-level embedded systems, hands-on circuit simulations, or machine learning experiments. I believe in learning by building, and that's exactly what you'll find here. 👨‍💻⚡
