# 👋 Hi there, I'm Erkhembileg

🎓 I'm a **Computer Engineering** student at the **University of Utah** with a passion for integrating **hardware** and **software** into meaningful projects. Whether it's developing AI models, analyzing electrical circuits, or simulating systems, I enjoy turning ideas into reality through creativity and logic.

This GitHub is where I share my journey — from low-level embedded systems to machine learning and hands-on circuit design. 🚀
