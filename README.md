# README.md

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Erkhembileg, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Utah with a passion for bridging the gap between hardware and software. Whether it's building intelligent systems with C++, designing real-world electrical circuits, or experimenting with AI models, I'm always eager to bring ideas to life through code and innovation.

This GitHub is where I share my personal projects â€” from low-level embedded systems to cutting-edge machine learning prototypes. Stay tuned for hands-on work that blends logic, creativity, and a love for engineering.

Letâ€™s build something awesome. ðŸ’¡
